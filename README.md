Applied **Data Scientist & AI Engineer** building end-to-end analytics and ML-driven decision-support systems.  
I focus on turning **ambiguous business and operational problems** into **scalable, executable data products** - from data pipelines and optimization models to LLM-powered agents deployed in real production environments.

Currently at **McKinsey & Company**, working on analytics products for workforce planning and talent intelligence.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🧠 Full-Stack AI Agent
**LLM-powered analytics agent** that translates natural language questions into executable SQL and analytical workflows.  
Designed for decision-support use cases where stakeholders need fast, interpretable insights without manual querying, with guardrails for schema awareness and result validation.
