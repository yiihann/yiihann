Applied **Data Scientist & AI Engineer** building end-to-end analytics and ML-driven decision-support systems.

I specialize in transforming **ambiguous business and operational problems** into **scalable, executable data products** - spanning data pipelines, optimization models, and LLM-powered agents deployed in real-world production environments.

Currently at **McKinsey & Company**, working on analytics products for workforce planning and talent intelligence.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🧠 Full-Stack Agentic AI System for API Integration
An **agentic AI system** that guides developers from high-level intent to **production-ready full-stack code**, orchestrating API recommendation, documentation retrieval, and code generation through a multi-agent workflow.

The system decomposes the development process into specialized agents for **API selection**, **documentation scraping and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **backend/frontend code synthesis**, and **automated code review**, enabling fast and reliable API integration, reducing integration time from documentation exploration to deployable code.

> Tech: Python, LLM agents (AutoGen-style), RAG (Faiss), Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Flask/FastAPI  
🔗 Repo: [`full-stack-ai-agent`](https://github.com/yiihann/full-stack-ai-agent)

### 🏠 California Housing Affordability Optimization
An **ML- and optimization-driven decision-support system** for housing affordability in California, framing housing selection as a **multi-objective optimization problem** over affordability, safety, and accessibility rather than a traditional recommender system.

The project combines **predictive modeling** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with **constraint-based optimization** (MILP and heuristic methods) to maximize Quality of Life (QoL) under real-world affordability and policy constraints, enabling **scenario analysis for individual and policy-level evaluation**.

> Tech: Python, ML (RF, GBM), optimization (MILP, Simulated Annealing), statistical modeling

*(Note: project framing evolving)*

### 📈 FX Analytics Dashboard
An **interactive analytics and forecasting dashboard** for global FX markets, combining time-series analysis with **LSTM-based return forecasting** to support exploratory analysis and short-horizon decision-oriented scenario evaluation.

The system enables users to **analyze historical return dynamics**, evaluate model performance on held-out periods, and **simulate future FX return trajectories** across major currencies, providing a practical framework for decision-oriented financial analysis.
